EatIn Web Application


EatIn is a recipe-searching app that seeks to be optimized for mobile use.  Users can browse recipes via Yummly's API, based on keywords, ingredients to include, and ingredients not to include.  

Users who register can create their own profiles, which includes the ability to add ingredients to their grocery lists from recipe pages, and to mark recipes as favorites.

While Yummly's API does not allow procedural directions for meal preparation, external links are available to users.
